**IMPORTANT**: This version of the app is deprecated, new development is happening in React: [Sentinel Playground](https://github.com/sinergise/SentinelPlayground)

Sentinel Playground version with [jQuery](https://jquery.com/). It uses NodeJS and Webpack to generate whole bundle.

### Installation
```
- npm Install
- open index.js and get and insert your Sentinel API key
- npm start (for local testing)
- npm run build (prepare application for deploy)
```

## Acquiring Sentinel API key
To use Sentinel WMS service, you need to have your API key. You can get test API key by writing mail to [info@sinergise.com](mailto:info@sinergise.com).
For more info about WMS service, check [www.sentinel-hub.com/apps/wms]([http://www.sentinel-hub.com/apps/wms]).

## Have more ideas?
We will be very happy to view some of your own implementation of our Sentinel Playground.
