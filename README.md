Sentinel Playground version with (jQuery)[https://jquery.com/]. It uses NodeJS and Webpack to generate whole bundle.

### Installation
```

- open index.js and get and insert your Sentinel API key
- npm start (for local testing)
- npm run build (prepare application for deploy)

## Acquiring Sentinel API key
To use Sentinel WMS service, you need to have your API key. You can get test API key by writing mail to [info@sinergise.com](mailto:info@sinergise.com).
